# NaVCh_Scaling

Welcome to the voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVChs) scaling analysis project!

Step 1. To begin, create a directory in your home directory by executing the following command in a terminal:

mkdir ~/hydroscale

This creates the directory /home/xxx/hydroscale, where xxx is your username.

Step 2. Place the following files in the newly created hydroscale directory:

    Methods.py
    ModelParameters.py
    Tools.py
    reduce.rad

You can use the mv or cp command to move or copy these files into /home/xxx/hydroscale:

mv Methods.py ModelParameters.py Tools.py reduce.rad ~/hydroscale/

Replace mv with cp if you want to copy the files instead of moving them.
